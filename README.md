# Welcome!,

Hiya, I'm a repository for a Hartree-Fock program, I was developed
using Roothaan Equations, also I'm only work for closed shells (RHF).

I have five flavors FORTRAN, Julia, C++, go and python. Why?..., because the
developer is learning about that programing languages. All flavors use the same
input files.

## about me

Feel free to send me a message if you find something interesting or improvable
about the code. Also you have a PDF with the necessary theory about
Hartree-Fock, if you find issues just tell me, I'm doing this with all my love
:sparkling_heart:.

## More

The [Nika proyect repository]() has an extended version of the kernel of this
program, but its wirtten only in FORTRAN. Nika proyect can compute open shell
systems (UHF), MP2 and DFT calculations. This repository was made particularly
to improve my skills in other programming languages.
