# Welcome!,

Hiya, I'm the repository about Hartree Fock program, I'm developed
using the Roothaan Equations, also I'm only work for closed shells (RHF).

I have five flavors FORTRAN, Julia, C++, go and python. Why?...,
because the developer is learning about that languages. The main branch is the
fusion of four branches, one branch about the flavor.

## Me

Feel free to send me a message if you find something interesting on the code. Also
you have a PDF with the theory necessary about Hartree-Fock, if you find issues just tell me,
I'm doing this with all my love of my heart :sparkling_heart:

## More

The Nika repository has an extended version of the kernel of this program, but just
in FORTRAN. Nika proyect can compute open shell systems, MP2 and DFT calculations. This repository was made
particularly to improve the programming languages.
