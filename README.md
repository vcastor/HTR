# Welcome,

Hiya, I'm the repository about Hartree Fock program, I'm developed
using the Roothaan Equations, also I'm only work for closed shells.

I have four flavors :grin: FORTRAN, Julia, C++, go and python. Why?...,
because the developer is learning about that languages. The main branch is the
fusion of four branches, one branch about the flavor.

## Me

Feel free to send me a message if you find something interesting on the code. Also
you have a PDF with the theory necessary about Hartree-Fock, if you find issues just tell me,
I'm doing this with all my love of my heart :sparkling_heart:

## More

The repository Nika has a extended version of the kernel of this repository, but just
in FORTRAN. Nika can compute open shell systems and DFT. This repository was made
particularly for improve other programming languages.
