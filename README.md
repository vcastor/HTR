#Welcome,

Hiya, I'm the respository about Hartree Fock program, I'm developed
using the Roothaan Equations, also I'm only work for closed shells.

I have four flavores :grin: fortran, julia, C++ and python. That becuase the developer
is learning about that languajes. The main branch is the fussion of four branches,
one branch about the flavor.

##me

Feel free to send me a message if you find something interesing on the code. Also
you have a pdf with the theory necessary about Hartree-Fock, if you find issues just tell me,
I'm doing this with all my love of my heart :sparkling_heart:
