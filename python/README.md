# Hello!

Here you have a python3 version of a program
that can compute Hartree-Fock-Roothaan algorithm
for closed shells.

As the other version of this program, it uses the input
files that is given for all versions and the values
for the basis set are also the same.

We did this version to learn more about python3. The
main branch is written in Fortran, any suggestion
of the code or how can improve my python skills will
be wellcome!

Bonne journ√©e!
And goood luck if you found something interestin in the code.
